## Hello! I'm Fabian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer from Hong Kong. I graduated from [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/) majored in Computer Science.

I started off teaching myself design and web development. And I was fortunate that JavaScript frameworks started to take over the Internet and I'm able to extend my skills to full stack development! Currently, I'm a Dev at [SoFi HK](https://www.sofi.hk/) where we develop an easy-to-use mobile investment platform.

I'm not the most logical engineer you'll meet. But I'm proud to be someone that sees the world in a humanistic perspective. This helps us me understand and build products with seamless user experience and aesthetically pleasing.
