Before ending your job interview that you’ve probably prepared hard for, you would usually get the chance to ask questions. Every one could excel in their technical / personality / cultural interview because it’s about **YOU**. But what’s the point of getting the job if you don’t know about **THEM**?

Of course, you could google about the companies you are interested in. But they could be sugar-coated information. It’s always the best to ask someone in-person. This way you can get the most straight-forward, less filtered information from companies.
